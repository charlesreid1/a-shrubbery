# Census Map

This is based on the adventure documented here: [http://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Census Map](http://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Census_Map)

The ```search_tables.py``` script will perform a keyword search and 
return tables and table codes whose names and/or contents match.
These can be used to query those tables using the Census Reporter API.
