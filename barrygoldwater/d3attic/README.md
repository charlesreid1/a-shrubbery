# D3 map

## How it works

Obtain contour data from national map viewer service.

Put it (shapefile and other associated files) in this directory.

Run the makefile, make -f ./topo.mk

## Problems

This doesn't work.

First, centering the map on the data was tedious and required by-hand tweaking.

Second, the contours weren't drawn the way I was expecting.
