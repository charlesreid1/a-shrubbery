# d3sert

This is the sandbox where I play with D3 examples 
to try and make them work for me.

Eventually, Leaflet and D3 will be hooked up together.
Interactive Leaflet maps will trigger D3 plots and things.

## Strategy

Set a simple target, or a simple series of targets.

Make it really simple.

Proeprocess everything in Python.

Spoon-feed D3 **whatever** it wants...
